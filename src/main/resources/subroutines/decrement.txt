# Binary arithmetic - unsigned decrement operation
# loosely based on https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos126/lectures/18-Turing-2x2.pdf

# starts on the left and head to the right before we start to decrement
δ : Û × 1 → Ý × 1 × R
δ : Ý × 1 → Ý × 1 × R
δ : Ý × 0 → Ý × 0 × R
δ : Ý × − → Þ × − × L

# if the number is zero, we do not decrement (strictly unsigned operation)
δ : Û × 0 → Û × 0 × R
# Ü is exit state
δ : Û × − → Ü × − × N

# we are on the right, let's decrement
δ : Þ × 0 → Þ × 1 × L
# exit
δ : Þ × 1 → Ü × 0 × L
