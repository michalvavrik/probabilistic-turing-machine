# Special case of the congruence modulo
# for given 'a' and 'n' this operation computes a^(n-1)≡1 (mod n)
# if above-mentioned is true (n is prime or Fermat pseudoprime), operation ends with 1, otherwise with 0 (Fermat witness)
# expected format is 'a' and 'n' separated with single blank symbol and number of blank symbols between n and ~binary-number must
be exactly number of digits of 'n' + 3 (more is acceptable, for less the behavior is undefined): ###a#n##~binary-number
# contract: it is possible to save any characters next to the 'n' if separated with at least one blank symbol
# for example: ###2#3##~100110 will result in 1~100110, symbols '~100110' are guaranteed to stay intact

# we expect to start on the left, that's for 2#3..., when it comes to state Ī, head should be on 2
# now rewrite a#n###~binary-number to a^n#n###~binary-number

# a#n###~binary-number -> a^n#n###~binary-number
